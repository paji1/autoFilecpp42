# autoFilecpp42

## To use the script in the autoFilecpp42 repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   `git clone git@github.com:paji1/autoFilecpp42.git`

2. Navigate to the directory and run the `installer` script using the following command:

   `./installer`

   This will install the necessary dependencies and make the `cppfile` script executable.

3. To use the `cppfile` script, provide it with the filenames you want to create as arguments. For example, to create `filename1.cpp` and `filename1.hpp`, run the following command:

   `./cppfile filename1 ...`

The script will create the necessary CPP and HPP files with orthodoxy calculations in the same directory as the script.
